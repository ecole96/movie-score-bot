# movie-score-bot
reddit bot for /r/movies that parses official discussion threads and gathers critic/audience scores for the film being discussed, averages all these scores, and determines if critics and audiences agree.

Unfortunately this bot was banned due to dumb rules on /r/movies, but it was nonetheless an education experience on web scraping and deployment (on Heroku). Sad it's not posting anymore, but I don't regret developing it.
